I performed the following steps to get the inkscape design into PCB:

 1. Export to PS with text converted to outlines
 2. Convert to PCB with:
    pstoedit -usebbfrominput -flat 0.001 -f pcb:-mm silk.ps silk.pcb
 3. Fix the holes in letters with PolyCombine:

 4. Move the two parts of the SR logo to another layer using PCB
 5. Open the PCB file with a text editor and manually make the SR part of the logo into a hole in the circle
 6. Move all of the polygons to the lower silk layer using a text editor
 7. Import the PCB file into the main layout
 8. Mirror the silk so that it's the right way around
 9. Position it

The moral of the story is get it right first time ;)
